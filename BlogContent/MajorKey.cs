            @"<p>The purpose for writing today is to share the single, powerful characteristic that I’ve discovered during the course of my recovery from addiction, combat-ptsd, and related mental health conditions that has allowed me to prevent the lows that are inevitable in life from descending to irrecoverable depths.</p>                
            <p>Consider that a “tease”. Because, before I can reveal this useful tool, I need to first describe the situation that has prompted its use.Context will provide legitimacy to my claim of its effectiveness.</p>
            <p>So, a little background…</p>
            <h3><b>WHAT HAPPENED IN APRIL:</b></h3>
            <p>During the fourth month of 2019 (and, really, some time before), <i>I fell in love</i>.</p>
            <p>The post you are currently reading isn’t intended to be an ode to love.Nor a tale of love lost.But to understand the potential devastation of an event I recently experienced, you need to know the strength of my feelings leading to it.</p>
            <p>I began dating a woman who I quickly believed (believe?) to be “the one”.</p>
            <p>During a lifetime of arrogance, I had always hesitated from ceding any of my independence for the sake of adoration because— oh, my humility! — I was certain that a partner, no matter how much she brought to my life, would slow me down from achieving the goals upon which the trajectory of my life depended.</p>
            <p>(Trust me, I know that I was not a good person.)</p>
            <p>But she made me a better one.</p>
            <p>And as far as slowing me down? Suddenly, I discovered a companion to whom I struggled to keep up!</p>
            <p>Anyway… The point now is only to demonstrate the significance of my emotion, and our connection(because they are pertinent to today’s actual point). To the latter, our connection, a real-life example is good indication:</p>
            <p>I despise the act of eating(Wait, wut? Bear with me here):</p>
            <p>Seriously, I’ve always thought of eating as a means to an end; a method of providing fuel to allow my body and mind to perform the tasks that I enjoy.It’s all pragmatic to me and I’ve said, for a very long time, that if I could get all necessary sustenance from a pill, I’d prefer the time saved by taking that over actually preparing and consuming food.</p>
            <p>Such a pill doesn’t exist. But, peanut butter does.And I eat a monumental amount of it. To the point that when friends think of me, their natural word association is first to my dog, Roux, but then to peanut butter.It’s crazy. I know.</p>
            <p>So, it was obviously true love when I discovered that the woman of my affection and dreams shared my weird addiction — with a cabinet full of the All-Natural, crunchy type I prefer, as evidence.</p>";

            @"<h3><b>MOVING ON:</b></h3>
            <p>Recall that <a href=""https://medium.com/@sbogucki12/what-happened-in-december-317140f0a356"" target=""_blank"">“What Happened in December”</a> was in part caused by the loss of a relationship with a girl; a girl for whom my feeling seemed intense then, but — in retrospect — was a pebble relative to my galactic feeling for the woman described above.</p>
            <p>So, you might think that losing this last relationship — which I did very recently — would crush me.</p>
            <p><b><i>But I’m good.</i></b></p>
            <p>Seriously.</p>
            <p>I mean, it hurts — no doubt.</p>
            <p>And, though I’m not at all angry (Admittedly, I was for a second during the actual moment of breakup), I do have the natural feeling of disappointment. I also harbor a bit of confusion with the lingering question of what I should have done better; which to me, is a healthy indicator that I will learn from this.</p>
            <p>All of this brings us to the one characteristic — the ultimate internal survival mechanism — to which I alluded at the very beginning of this writing.</p>
            <p>Because it isn’t magic that I’m coping now in the whole opposite way than I had in December.</p>";

        public static string blogContentPart3 =
            @"<p><i>I have found that there is no weapon in my arsenal more effective in overcoming hurdles during recovery than the immense power of <b>positive self-worth</b>.</i></p>
            <p>You were expecting something more tangible? “<b>Positive self-worth</b>” seems a little too cliché for its effectiveness to be real.</p>
            <p>I know.</p>
            <p>Just hear me out:</p>            
            <ul>
            <li>When the job became too much for me in December, it was devastating because I had searched for employment without luck for so long prior to being hired.</li>
            <li>When things broke down with the girl in December, it was heartbreaking because affection like hers was totally new to me.</li>
            <li>When I was smoking too much weed (before, during, and after December), it seemed like a quality sort of life was unobtainable for me without it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whether any of those observations were true or not (they weren’t), it doesn’t matter. It mattered then that I thought they were true.</p>
            <p>In December, my sense of self-worth was zero. I felt that I had stumbled into the job, was lucky to have the girl, and that my happiness was dependent on the crutch of the intoxicant.</p>
            <p>Since December, not a whole lot — tangibly — has changed. Sure, I haven’t smoked weed in over a month, and I was offered a job, etc.; but these are comparative minutiae.</p>
            <p>What has changed a whole lot has been my mindset. My sense of self-worth since December has increased exponentially.</p>
            <p>Which isn’t to say that I feel like I’m Bradley Cooper in the eyes of women, that potential employers are throwing money at me, or that absolutely everything is rosy in a life abstinent from intoxicants.</p>
            <p>But I do know that I have appealing aspects, that I’m capable of hard work, and have demonstrated during the past month no need for anything external to myself to bring real satisfaction to my life.</p>
            <p>For once I am comfortable with myself.</p>
            <p>My sense of self-worth has grown so tremendously that I literally can’t even imagine allowing anything external to myself to pull me down; at least not to the dangerous abysmal levels of December.</p>
            <p>No one failure — nor any combination of many — is more significant than my own well-being.</p>
            <p><b><i>Literally, the value of my self-worth is greater than the sum of my experiences.</i></b></p>
            <p>Once you achieve a positive sense of self-worth, healthy perspective follows. You discover that the good, the bad, and everything in between are all just experiences. <b>They aren’t you</b>.</p>";

        public static string blogContentPart4 =
            @"<p>I’ve found that life is a bit like a roller coaster. But I’m not the roller coaster. I’m not the agonizing ascent up the hill. I’m not the thrilling descent of the drop. I’m not the painful whip of the racing corners.</p>
            <p>I’m the passenger.</p>
            <p>And my self-worth is the internal sensation that I have upon boarding the ride. If I’m convinced that it will be frightening, it likely will be. If I’m excited for the adventure, I’ll probably have fun. If I’m too cool to be bothered by any of it at all, I probably won’t be.</p>
            <p>Roller coasters are effective because they trick your mind. Despite being almost totally secure, the ride convinces you that it’s going to be the end of it all.</p>
            <p>But positive self-worth, I promise you, allows you to see beyond life’s roller-coaster-like deception and enjoy the ups, downs, and everything else it might deliver.</p>
            <p>Because that’s all they are: Just segments of the ride.</p>
            <p>Breaking up with someone you thought was the love of your life is hard. So is experiencing combat. Or escaping from addiction. But these events are just the ups, downs, twists and turns of the roller coaster of life.</p>
            <p>Once you realize that you are more powerful than the ride, you have the tool — positive self-worth — that allows you to stop being victim to it.</p>";
