            <p>This is a true story that, by nature, will require over-sharing. One detail specifically will be especially cringe-worthy for some. Appropriate warning will be provided prior to that particular section.</p>

            <p>Prior to December, 2018, I had been hired by a consultancy company in Virginia and was working remote from my residence in Long Beach, California. We had just been awarded a relatively significant contract from the federal government. I was positioned to lead — for lack of a more appropriate term — the technical aspects of the project.</p>

            <p>Not long before December, I had begun dating a girl to whom I was immediately and passionately attracted.</p>

            <p>While I had not drank alcohol for many years, for the better part of 2018, I had been consuming cannabis at an ever increasing — and daily — rate.</p>

            <p>When I quit drinking, I decided to abandon all my friends and isolate myself completely. I told myself that the reason for doing so was to eliminate any distraction from self-improvement, but I knew in my heart that this choice was consequence of some deep and difficult-to-convey shame.</p>

            <p>Well before any of this, I served in the Army and completed two combat tours of Iraq. More relevant to the story at hand, I had also volunteered for Special Forces training. Achieving my membership on an SF ODA was a life-goal that I had inexplicably quit during training.</p>

            <h3><b>THE ASCENT (DESCENT?):</b></h3>

            <p>As December approached, it became increasingly clear to me that I had “bitten off more than I could chew” in regards to the project at work. I expressed my desire to my management to have someone more experienced fulfill my role as technical lead, but failed to share how much I was increasingly becoming convinced that the project’s success was unrealistic. The pending failure weighed on me. More than I was aware.</p>

            <p>Cannabis had transitioned from being a helpful therapeutic tool — one that alleviated my recurring evening nightmares that regularly disrupted my sleep — to a crutch that I was using throughout each day. Even now, I have no opposition to the moderate use of cannabis, especially as part of a strategy to assist gaining alternative perspective to challenging problems (I had found it especially beneficial when I was trying to solve complex algorithmic software development issues when I often otherwise reached my cognitive limits). But, being prone to addiction, I began to relish the high itself more than reality, and was increasingly comfortable in a damaging way with sacrificing real life for the one provided by the intoxicant.</p>

            <p>Often, I found myself alarmingly nostalgic for my time in the military. Since quitting Special Forces training, I had changed tremendously as a person, and had developed deep guilt about my actions in combat. Yet, every single day I wished to return to chasing the dream. In order to overcome the personal disappointment of quitting and to quell the sense of dishonor I felt for having failed. There’s another story here that I must share — but it’s for a different time.</p>

            <h3><b><i>WARNING - DEEPLY PERSONAL AWKWARD EXPLICIT OVERSHARING FOLLOWS:</i></b></h3>

            <p>Despite all of this, for the first time in my life, my self-confidence was growing. I had always been extremely self-conscious about the overcrowding of my teeth; to the point that the issue had been an obstacle that prevented me from approaching women. At immense financial expense (lol, but cry, but also lol), I finally had my teeth repaired and immediately began experiencing different — positive! — reactions from women than I had ever previously. Not so much because of the smile but mostly because of the confidence that the smile promoted.</p>

            <p>I began to date a woman who was beautiful in the same astounding way as the women who, in the past, I had always lacked the confidence to approach. Our connection was real and immediate. And it quickly attempted to become sexual. When … my body failed me. I experienced the sort of male inability that is completely devastating to a dude — or, well, this one at least.</p>

            <p>She was super supportive, but my own instinct was not. As in all things, my biggest enemy in this case was the one who provokes from inside my own head.</p>

            <p>Given my desire for her, I was extremely confused by my own bodily failing. And I had demonically harmful thoughts and questions. As in, if I can’t achieve happiness with her, then with whom can I? If one buys into the concept that humans are by nature pro-creators and that all we do -from work to self-improvement- is an exercise to achieve that basic human need, then what exactly is a person to think when they suddenly discover themselves completely helpless at that task??</p>

            <p>I was crushed. Not so much from losing the girl — though I did. But from the heavy despair of thinking I literally couldn’t achieve the most basic and natural of satisfaction.</p>

            <h3><b><i>END- DEEPLY PERSONAL AWKWARD EXPLICIT OVERSHARING.</i></b></h3>

            <h3><b>NEXT:</b></h3>

            <p>In early December, a few days before my birthday, I was on a conference call with the leadership committee from the federal government who were overseeing our project. During the course of that early morning discussion, inexplicably and unprovoked, every bad feeling associated with all described above hit me at once.</p>

            <p>I can’t say that I became suicidal exactly. Also, I can’t exactly say that I didn’t become suicidal.</p>

            <p>Right now, it’s a struggle to accurately convey the thoughts that I had that morning. Not because of embarrassment, but because they were so atypical from any that I have ever before dealt. As sui generis things go, they have no comparables, but here is my feeble attempt to describe:</p>

            <p>Suddenly, in my head, everything began racing. Zoom! These weren’t coherent thoughts but just flashes of mental anguish. A somewhat funny analogy, but I could sense my mental synapses in a very real way, and they felt like racecars bouncing into each other and against my inner skull. And physically I became sick. I vomited. Multiple times. And my heart sped such that I felt it may explode.</p>

            <p>The worst part was that I knew not where to turn.</p>

            <p>My closest confidant is my Mom. As dear and trusted as she is, at that moment, I needed someone else. I don’t know why, but I just did. But there was no one. I had turned my back on literally everyone who had cared for me throughout my life. I had always felt strong and took pride in my independence but, at that moment, I felt vulnerable. And desperately lonely.</p>

            <p>I don’t know exactly what my plan was, but I do know that anything I was about to do wasn’t going to be good.</p>

            <p>But… I was wrong. Thankfully.</p>

            <p>I chose the one potentially positive option and entered an online chat with the Veterans’ Crisis Helpline (HERE, for those who need it!!! It works!). Their concern was overwhelming and necessary. They immediately followed our internet discussion with a phone call and directed me to the VA hospital with instructions that if I did not report within 20 minutes, they would send authorities to seek me.</p>

            <p>In the mental health emergency room of the Long Beach VA, I was greeted with care from the moment I entered. For my own well-being, they admitted me into an in-person stay.</p>

            <p>— — Now, to overcome embarrassment that frankly I should not have ever felt, I’ve been telling people that I had attended in-person rehab at the VA. This is not exactly true. Having been identified as potentially harmful to myself, I was actually admitted to the VA’s mental health clinic. Which, to be honest, in past times, was referred to in much more derogatory terms: as in, the psych ward. — -</p>

            <p>Labels be what they may, the attention I received there was tremendous. Just knowing that the VA existed as a resource alleviated so much burden alone. Long story, short (wait… I’m long past that!): I spent three days in the hospital, one of which included my birthday.</p>

            <h3><b>THE RECOVERY:</b></h3>

            <p>Upon being discharged from the VA, I felt worlds’ better. In fact, I thought I was near fully recovered but I later learned this certainly wasn’t the case.</p>

            <p>Throughout my ordeal, my employer continued to contact me. With the most caring and positive of intentions. But, for reasons I still can’t explain (Guilt? Shame?), I was unable — and am still unable — to contact them. The emails and voicemails that they sent, from the little I saw and heard of them at glance and in passing — seemed so caring. But I still have read none of the words in full and listened to zero of the voicemails in their entirety. I. Just. Can’t.</p>

            <p>From what I know, despite failing them completely, they have continued to permit my return to employment. I’m grateful for that. Truly. But there are emotions connected now that I simply can not yet address. So, as immature as it may seem, I continue to practice avoidance and ignorance in regards to that organization. Trust me, no one knows more than me how wrong I am for that choice.</p>

            <p>While in the hospital, I was prescribed Zoloft and following release, I continued to consume cannabis. About three weeks ago, my strength had returned such that I decided to abstain from both; perhaps not forever but at least for now. I haven’t used either since that day and on a daily basis, I have felt my self-confidence and personal empowerment grow. To such a point that I can freely share this story now.</p>

            <p>At this very moment, I feel better mentally and physically than I have ever in my life. Intellectually, I feel on top of my game in ways that I have never before. I’ve lost weight and body fat, gained muscle, and have become comfortable in my own skin in ways that were previously unfamiliar. I’ve regained passion for music and mental stimulation. I’ve been spending time with a woman who I admire tremendously, but armed with the lessons of the past experience, I am prepared to handle in a healthy way whatever may come for us — either good or bad — in ways that I was totally unable before the event in December. And, perhaps most importantly, I’m slowly trying to reconnect with the friends who I had abandoned. Who, inexplicably, despite my cowardice and disregard for them, have perpetually texted, messaged, and tried to reconnect. In futility. Until now.</p>

            <h3><b>MORAL OF THE STORY:</b></h3>

            <p>I guess my point in sharing all of this is:</p>

            <ol>
            <li>1. For the therapeutic benefit that comes from streaming thoughts and emotions to words in a public way;</li>

            <li>2. To fill in some gaps for those who knew that something — but not what exactly — occurred to me in December; and</li>

            <li>3. To demonstrate that one can ascend from the deepest of depths.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Obviously, my story isn’t yet complete. I have a far way to go. But what I have discovered is that small, but fundamental changes in life can alter substantially an entire mindset. For me, these changes have revealed a new version of me that I never knew existed. I have discovered a type of happiness and lifestyle that I never even knew that I wanted. And from the perspective of where I am now, I can’t imagine ever turning back.</p>

            <p>I hope my experience may be inspiration in some form to anyone else who desires something similar.</p>

            <p>I appreciate you taking the time to read. And for all the support I have received, I want to share my most sincere gratitude.</p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>";
